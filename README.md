# DecisionMaker
Python script to quantify factors in a decision

## How to use
- Fill in "input.csv" with the categories at the top and perks in columns below them.
- If number of perks in each column is uneven, make up difference with "-".
- Run "main.py".
- Give each perk as it appears a value between 1-5, depending on how important they are. Some will repeat.
- See a therapist about your difficulty making decisions.
